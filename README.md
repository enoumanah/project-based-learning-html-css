# Project-Based Learning: HTML-CSS

This repo contains multiple mini-projects to learn and practice HTML and CSS through building 

## Projects

### 1. Loading Page
This is my very first project in my learning Journey for HTML and CSS. It features a simple, clean loading icon created purely with HTML and CSS animations. Perfect for practicing the basics of styling and automation.

### 2. Calculator 
Project 2 in my HTML & CSS (plus a bit of JS) track. This is a basic on-screen calculator that actually does math—built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 3. Simple Landing Page
This is the third project in my HTML/CSS project-based learning path. It's a clean and responsive landing page built with just HTML and CSS — no frameworks, no fancy JS — just raw front-end fundamentals.
